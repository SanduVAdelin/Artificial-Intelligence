computers host websites composed of html and send text messages as simple as...lol.....current research includes cache design and algorithms that can predict what data is likely to be needed next and preload it into the cache for improved performance.....current research includes cache design and algorithms that can predict what data is likely to be needed next and preload it into the cache for improved performance.....linked to the i/o controllers are secondary storage devices, such as a disk drive, that are slower and have a larger capacity than main or cache memory.....they can be either permanently or temporarily attached to the computer in the form of a compact disc (cd), a digital video disc (dvd), or a memory stick (also called a flash drive).....the first instruction is transferred from ram into the control unit and interpreted by the hardware circuitry.....most importantly, computer languages include conditional instructions—essentially, rules that say, “if memory location n satisfies condition a, do instruction number x next, otherwise do instruction y.” this allows the course of a program to be determined by the results of previous operations—a critically important ability.....vlsi microprocessor design occurs in a number of stages, which include creating the initial functional or behavioral specification, encoding this specification into a hardware description language, and breaking down the design into modules and generating sizes and shapes for the eventual chip components.....vlsi microprocessor design occurs in a number of stages, which include creating the initial functional or behavioral specification, encoding this specification into a hardware description language, and breaking down the design into modules and generating sizes and shapes for the eventual chip components.....vlsi microprocessor design occurs in a number of stages, which include creating the initial functional or behavioral specification, encoding this specification into a hardware description language, and breaking down the design into modules and generating sizes and shapes for the eventual chip components.....it also involves chip planning, which includes building a “floor plan” to indicate where on the chip each component should be placed and connected to other components.....computer scientists are also involved in creating the computer-aided design (cad) tools that support engineers in the various stages of chip design and in developing the necessary theoretical results, such as how to efficiently design a floor plan with near-minimal area that satisfies the given constraints.....for example, in 1971 the first microprocessor chip (intel corporation’s 4004) had only 2,300 transistors, in 1993 intel’s pentium chip had more than 3 million transistors, and by 2000 the number of transistors on such a chip was about 50 million.....to ensure fault tolerance, key components are often replicated so that the backup component can take over if needed.....for example, an advantage of a distributed database is that data replicated on different network hosts can provide a natural backup mechanism when one host fails.....computational science

computational science applies computer simulation, scientific visualization, mathematical modeling, algorithms, data structures, networking, database design, symbolic computation, and high-performance computing to help advance the goals of various disciplines.....the requirements of big-data scientific problems, including the solution of ever larger systems of equations, engage the use of large and powerful arrays of processors (called multiprocessors or supercomputers) that allow many calculations to proceed in parallel by assigning them to separate processing elements.....graphics and visual computing

graphics and visual computing is the field that deals with the display and control of images on a computer screen.....cad systems allow the computer to be used for designing objects ranging from automobile parts to bridges to computer chips by providing an interactive drawing tool and an engineering interface to simulation and analysis tools.....cad systems allow the computer to be used for designing objects ranging from automobile parts to bridges to computer chips by providing an interactive drawing tool and an engineering interface to simulation and analysis tools.....cad systems allow the computer to be used for designing objects ranging from automobile parts to bridges to computer chips by providing an interactive drawing tool and an engineering interface to simulation and analysis tools.....medical imaging applications involve the visualization of data obtained from technologies such as x-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (mris) to assist doctors in diagnosing medical conditions.....scientific visualization uses massive amounts of data to define simulations of scientific phenomena, such as ocean modeling, to produce pictures that provide more insight into the phenomena than would tables of numbers.....in many applications, still pictures are inadequate, and rapid display of real-time images is required.....both extremely efficient algorithms and state-of-the-art hardware are needed to accomplish real-time animation.....hci occurs at an interface that includes both software and hardware.....user interface design impacts the life cycle of software, so it should occur early in the design process.....
