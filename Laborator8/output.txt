computer architecture deals with the design of computers, data storage devices, and networking components that store and run programs, transmit data, and drive interactions between computers, across networks, and with users.
computer architects use parallelism and various strategies for memory organization to design computing systems with very high performance.
computer architecture requires strong communication between computer scientists and computer engineers, since they both focus fundamentally on hardware design.
at its most fundamental level, a computer consists of a control unit, an arithmetic logic unit (alu), a memory unit, and input/output (i/o) controllers.
the alu performs simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and logic operations, such as or and and.
the control unit fetches data and instructions from memory and uses operations of the alu to carry out those instructions using that data.
(the control unit and alu together are referred to as the central processing unit [cpu].)
when an input or output instruction is encountered, the control unit transfers the data between the memory and the designated i/o controller.
the operational speed of the cpu primarily determines the speed of the computer as a whole.
all of these components‚Äîthe control unit, the alu, the memory, and the i/o controllers‚Äîare realized with transistor circuits.

computers also have another level of memory called a cache, a small, extremely fast (compared with the main memory, or random access memory [ram]) unit that can be used to store information that is urgently or frequently needed.
current research includes cache design and algorithms that can predict what data is likely to be needed next and preload it into the cache for improved performance.
i/o controllers connect the computer to specific input devices (such as keyboards and touch screen displays) for feeding information to the memory, and output devices (such as printers and displays) for transmitting information from the memory to users.
additional i/o controllers connect the computer to a network via ports that provide the conduit through which data flows when the computer is connected to the internet.
linked to the i/o controllers are secondary storage devices, such as a disk drive, that are slower and have a larger capacity than main or cache memory.
disk drives are used for maintaining permanent data.
they can be either permanently or temporarily attached to the computer in the form of a compact disc (cd), a digital video disc (dvd), or a memory stick (also called a flash drive).

the operation of a computer, once a program and some data have been loaded into ram, takes place as follows.
the first instruction is transferred from ram into the control unit and interpreted by the hardware circuitry.
for instance, suppose that the instruction is a string of bits that is the code for load 10. this instruction loads the contents of memory location 10 into the alu.
the control unit then loads the contents of memory location 15 into the alu and adds it to the number already there.
finally, the instruction store 20 would store that sum into location 20. at this level, the operation of a computer is not much different from that of a pocket calculator.
in general, programs are not just lengthy sequences of load, store, and arithmetic operations.
most importantly, computer languages include conditional instructions‚Äîessentially, rules that say, ‚Äúif memory location n satisfies condition a, do instruction number x next, otherwise do instruction y.‚Äù this allows the course of a program to be determined by the results of previous operations‚Äîa critically important ability.
finally, programs typically contain sequences of instructions that are repeated a number of times until a predetermined condition becomes true.
such a sequence is called a loop.
for example, a loop would be needed to compute the sum of the first n integers, where n is a value stored in a separate memory location.
computer architectures that can execute sequences of instructions, conditional instructions, and loops are called ‚Äúturing complete,‚Äù which means that they can carry out the execution of any algorithm that can be defined.
turing completeness is a fundamental and essential characteristic of any computer organization.
logic design is the area of computer science that deals with the design of electronic circuits using the fundamental principles and properties of logic (see boolean algebra) to carry out the operations of the control unit, the alu, the i/o controllers, and other hardware.
each logical function (and, or, and not) is realized by a particular type of device called a gate.
for example, the addition circuit of the alu has inputs corresponding to all the bits of the two numbers to be added and outputs corresponding to the bits of the sum.
the arrangement of wires and gates that link inputs to outputs is determined by the mathematical definition of addition.
the design of the control unit provides the circuits that interpret instructions.
due to the need for efficiency, logic design must also optimize the circuitry to function with maximum speed and has a minimum number of gates and circuits.
an important area related to architecture is the design of microprocessors, which are complete cpus‚Äîcontrol unit, alu, and memory‚Äîon a single integrated circuit chip.
additional memory and i/o control circuitry are linked to this chip to form a complete computer.
these thumbnail-sized devices contain millions of transistors that implement the processing and memory units of modern computers.
vlsi microprocessor design occurs in a number of stages, which include creating the initial functional or behavioral specification, encoding this specification into a hardware description language, and breaking down the design into modules and generating sizes and shapes for the eventual chip components.
it also involves chip planning, which includes building a ‚Äúfloor plan‚Äù to indicate where on the chip each component should be placed and connected to other components.
computer scientists are also involved in creating the computer-aided design (cad) tools that support engineers in the various stages of chip design and in developing the necessary theoretical results, such as how to efficiently design a floor plan with near-minimal area that satisfies the given constraints.
for example, in 1971 the first microprocessor chip (intel corporation‚Äôs 4004) had only 2,300 transistors, in 1993 intel‚Äôs pentium chip had more than 3 million transistors, and by 2000 the number of transistors on such a chip was about 50 million.
the power7 chip introduced in 2010 by ibm contained approximately 1 billion transistors.
the phenomenon of the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubling about every two years is widely known as moore‚Äôs law.
gordon e. moore observed that the number of transistors on a computer chip was doubling about every 18‚Äì24 months.

fault tolerance is the ability of a computer to continue operation when one or more of its components fails.
to ensure fault tolerance, key components are often replicated so that the backup component can take over if needed.
such applications as aircraft control and manufacturing process control run on systems with backup processors ready to take over if the main processor fails, and the backup systems often run in parallel so the transition is smooth.
if the systems are critical in that their failure would be potentially disastrous (as in aircraft control), incompatible outcomes collected from replicated processes running in parallel on separate machines are resolved by a voting mechanism.
computer scientists are involved in the analysis of such replicated systems, providing theoretical approaches to estimating the reliability achieved by a given configuration and processor parameters, such as average time between failures and average time required to repair the processor.
fault tolerance is also a desirable feature in distributed systems and networks.
for example, an advantage of a distributed database is that data replicated on different network hosts can provide a natural backup mechanism when one host fails.
computational science

computational science applies computer simulation, scientific visualization, mathematical modeling, algorithms, data structures, networking, database design, symbolic computation, and high-performance computing to help advance the goals of various disciplines.
these disciplines include biology, chemistry, fluid dynamics, archaeology, finance, sociology, and forensics.
computational science has evolved rapidly, especially because of the dramatic growth in the volume of data transmitted from scientific instruments.
this phenomenon has been called the ‚Äúbig data‚Äù problem.
the mathematical methods needed for computational science require the transformation of equations and functions from the continuous to the discrete.
for example, the computer integration of a function over an interval is accomplished not by applying integral calculus but rather by approximating the area under the function graph as a sum of the areas obtained from evaluating the function at discrete points.
similarly, the solution of a differential equation is obtained as a sequence of discrete points determined by approximating the true solution curve by a sequence of tangential line segments.
when discretized in this way, many problems can be recast as an equation involving a matrix (a rectangular array of numbers) solvable using linear algebra.
numerical analysis is the study of such computational methods.
several factors must be considered when applying numerical methods: (1) the conditions under which the method yields a solution, (2) the accuracy of the solution, (3) whether the solution process is stable (i.e., does not exhibit error growth), and (4) the computational complexity (in the sense described above) of obtaining a solution of the desired accuracy.
the requirements of big-data scientific problems, including the solution of ever larger systems of equations, engage the use of large and powerful arrays of processors (called multiprocessors or supercomputers) that allow many calculations to proceed in parallel by assigning them to separate processing elements.
these activities have sparked much interest in parallel computer architecture and algorithms that can be carried out efficiently on such machines.
graphics and visual computing

graphics and visual computing is the field that deals with the display and control of images on a computer screen.
this field encompasses the efficient implementation of four interrelated computational tasks: rendering, modeling, animation, and visualization.
graphics techniques incorporate principles of linear algebra, numerical integration, computational geometry, special-purpose hardware, file formats, and graphical user interfaces (guis) to accomplish these complex tasks.
applications of graphics include cad, fine arts, medical imaging, scientific data visualization, and video games.
cad systems allow the computer to be used for designing objects ranging from automobile parts to bridges to computer chips by providing an interactive drawing tool and an engineering interface to simulation and analysis tools.
fine arts applications allow artists to use the computer screen as a medium to create images, cinematographic special effects, animated cartoons, and television commercials.
medical imaging applications involve the visualization of data obtained from technologies such as x-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (mris) to assist doctors in diagnosing medical conditions.
scientific visualization uses massive amounts of data to define simulations of scientific phenomena, such as ocean modeling, to produce pictures that provide more insight into the phenomena than would tables of numbers.
graphics also provide realistic visualizations for video gaming, flight simulation, and other representations of reality or fantasy.
the term virtual reality has been coined to refer to any interaction with a computer-simulated virtual world.

a challenge for computer graphics is the development of efficient algorithms that manipulate the myriad of lines, triangles, and polygons that make up a computer image.
in order for realistic on-screen images to be presented, each object must be rendered as a set of planar units.
edges must be smoothed and textured so that their underlying construction from polygons is not obvious to the naked eye.
in many applications, still pictures are inadequate, and rapid display of real-time images is required.
both extremely efficient algorithms and state-of-the-art hardware are needed to accomplish real-time animation.
(for more technical details of graphics displays, see computer graphics.)
human-computer interaction

human-computer interaction (hci) is concerned with designing effective interaction between users and computers and the construction of interfaces that support this interaction.
hci occurs at an interface that includes both software and hardware.
user interface design impacts the life cycle of software, so it should occur early in the design process.
because user interfaces must accommodate a variety of user styles and capabilities, hci research draws on several disciplines including psychology, sociology, anthropology, and engineering.
in the 1960s, user interfaces consisted of computer consoles that allowed an operator directly to type commands that could be executed immediately or at some future time.
with the advent of more user-friendly personal computers in the 1980s, user interfaces became more sophisticated, so that the user could ‚Äúpoint and click‚Äù to send a command to the operating system.
thus, the field of hci emerged to model, develop, and measure the effectiveness of various types of interfaces between a computer application and the person accessing its services.
guis enable users to communicate with the computer by such simple means as pointing to an icon with a mouse or touching it with a stylus or forefinger.
this technology also supports windowing environments on a computer screen, which allow users to work with different applications simultaneously, one in each window.
